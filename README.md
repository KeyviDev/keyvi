Keyvi - the short form for "Key value index" is a key value store (KVS) optimized for size and lookup speed. The usage of shared memory makes it scalable and resistant. The biggest difference to other stores is the underlying data structure based on [finite state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine). Storage is very space efficient, fast and by design makes various sorts of approximate matching be it fuzzy string matching or geo highly efficient. The immutable FST data structure can be used stand-alone for static datasets. If you need online writes, you can use keyvi index, a _near realtime index_. The index can be used as embedded key value store, e.g. if you already have a network stack in your application. A out of the box network enabled store is available with [keyvi-server](https://github.com/KeyviDev/keyvi-server).

## Install

### Quick

Precompiled binary wheels are available for OS X and Linux on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyvi). To install use:

    pip install keyvi

### From Source

The core part is a C++ header-only library, which can be used stand-alone. For more information check the [Readme](/keyvi/README.md) file in the keyvi subfolder.

The python extension can be compiled standalone, check the [Readme](/python/README.md) file in the python subfolder for more information.

If you like to go deep down in the basics, keyvi is inspired by the following 2 papers:

  * Sparse Array (See Storing a Sparse Table, Robert E. Tarjan et al. http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/78/683/CS-TR-78-683.pdf)
  * Incremental, which means minimization is done on the fly (See Incremental Construction of Minimal Acyclic Finite-State Automata, J. Daciuk et al.: http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/089120100561601)
